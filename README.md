        <h1>:information_desk_person: Work Mate</h1>
        <p>This project is for the Digital Nomad project.</p>
        <p>We are working with 4 team members who are living in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and France. They are facing challenges working together due to time zone differences.</p>
        <p>We decided to make a website for people in different time zones to work together. It will make it easy to schedule meetings, check their working availability in local time, and be visually clear to understand.</p>
